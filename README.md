# BOM-comparator-fakeData
This repository is fake data version of my project BOM Comparator.  
Beacouse BOM Comparator contains sensitive data I created copy of BOM Comparator which could be public.    

BOM Comparator is the WFP application which was created to support fast and clever Bill Of Material comparison and analize.  
The input data: Team Center 7.5 report or CEWB SAP transaction --> both are .xls files.  
BOM Comparator could work with external data from .xls formats and alternatively it could load and update external database (which is not published for UI beacouse of company security restrictions).
